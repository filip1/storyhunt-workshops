## How to run a "Visualisation Gallery"
* The viz gallery is a great way to get familiar with different forms of visualisations from a user perspective. This is how you
can set up your own viz gallery:
* step 1: split up in small groups and try to answer these questions by looking at the different types of visualisation
- What’s the message?
- Who is it for?
- What’s the evidence or data contained?
* step 2: Discuss the visualisation: Which ones were the most effective? Why? & Which ones were the least effective? Why?
* step 3: collect the main aspects mentioned by the group
